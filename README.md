## Overview

This JavaScript program is a simple camera application. This app is capable
of taking pictures and storing them in a list. The user is prompted to
save the photo to their personal camera roll. The user can also share the
photo across platforms if needed. Built for IOS.

## Reflection

Using a list is something I am very comfortable with at this point in the semester
and did not have any issues here. For me, half of the project was getting my first
expo go project set up and downloading the packages needed. I used the information
from the lectures and even had to watch some Youtube videos to refresh myself. I was
able to get the Expo Go project set up in VS Code which was super beneficial because 
I use it regularly. I also have extensions downloaded for VS Code that helps keep
my code formatted correctly which is a small but nice feature. After getting the project
setup in my preferred IDE I had to download additional packages for the 'expo-media-library'
and the 'expo-camera'. I had to do some research on using the share mechanism used for
saving images to the user's photo gallery, as well as the sharing feature. Overall
this project was less code than i expected it to be. My app runs on IOS and has a very
simple and easy to use layout. The color scheme is easy on the eyes and has a red border
for the delete button and a blue one for share. This is important because the most used
apps follow this color scheme which makes it easier for the user. Another cool feature
allows the user to flip the camera to the front or back before taking a photo.
